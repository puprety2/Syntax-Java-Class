Constructors:
1) It is a special block of code/similar to a method that is executed when we create an object
    of a class
2) The purpose of constructors is to initialized our fields
3) They must have the name same as name of the class
4) Constructors do no have return type not even void
5) We can pass arguments to our constructors just like we do for our methods
Similarities between constructors and method
1) both can have parameters
2) both can have access modifiers like private, public, and protected/default
Differences between constructors and method
1) as we can use any name for our method but constructor and class has to be same name
2)constructors can not return values as method can
3)constructors are automatically called when an instance of the class is created.
When should we constructor:
when we want to control initialization of our fields
