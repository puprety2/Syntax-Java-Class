Yet another types of variables

1) Local :any variables that is declared inside of method or a block
like while loop , for loop, if condition, or inside the construction are
called Local variables
Properties:
- We can access them out side of the block
    for example: if(2>1){
                    int x=10//this variable will not be accessible outside
                    }
                    x=20//compiler error
- As soon as we are done with method local variables wont work
    and memory is freed and is available to be used by others programs

2) instance variables: all of the variables which are declared outside of the methods or blocks or construction
but inside the class are instance variables.
Properties:
- Memory is allocated inside RAM as soon as object of that class is created and stays in
the memory unless we are done with the closing bracket.
- They are highly discouraged because they waste are not efficient in handling memory.

3)static variables: They are declared outside of the methods, constructor, and block of codes
with a static keyword.

Access Modifier: keyword(private, public protected) that help us reduce the visibility of our variables and methods
so that no one else from other class or packages can modify our data.

 Private: if we use private access modifier our variables or methods we can only access that variable
 from same class
 class Account{
 private int balance;

 void depositMoney(){
 if(boolean properChannel, int money){
 balance=balance+money
 }
 }
 }
 class hacker{
 balance=100000 // compile error: cannot access
 }

 Default: its not a keyword, it is a behaviour which is assigned to the methods or property automatically
 if we are not assigning any access modifier.

package1;
 class{
 String car;
 }
 package2;
 class family{
 car="I am driving your car";
 }
 if we do not specify any modifiers, default behaviour will assigned to our variable
 and methods and they will only be available within the same package.
